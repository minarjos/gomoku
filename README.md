# Gomoku

Simple gomoku in terminal with relatively strong AI (probably strong enough to beat most humans but expirienced players should beat it without much effort).

## Usage

Run `gomoku.py` to play. There are a few optional arguments. They allow to set size of the board and time given to AI to think. By default, first player is human and second AI.

`-n BOARDSIZE, --boardsize BOARDSIZE`   Size of the board. Default value is 15.
                        
`-t TIME, --time TIME`    Time for AI per move in miliseconds. Default value is 1000.
  
`-o, --ostarts`         The player with O symbol starts.

`-p, --secondhuman`     Second player is human.

`-a, --firstai`         First player is ai.

Use arrows to move cursor and play a move by pressing enter.
